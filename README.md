SkeletonDancer
==============

:skull: :dancers: SkeletonDancer - PHP Project bootstrapping

A really simple (not completed) HPP project scaffolding tool.

*I got tired of having to copy-past and mess-up my configuration for every project,
so I created someting really simple cli tool using the Symfony Console and Twig.*

Whats with the name?
--------------------

Empty projects are sometimes reverted to as 'skeletons', this little tools makes them dance :smile:
And it was the only name, I could came-up with on the weekend.
